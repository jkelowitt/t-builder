# Titration Generator
Allows the user to plot any monoprotic, diprotic, or triprotic titration curve.

Run **main.py** to start the program.

There are 5 parts to the program:
  * The plot is where the titration curve is shown once all of the required data is input. 
  * The Titrant Section is where you select either a strong acid or a strong base as a titrant.
  * The Analyte Section is where you select whether the analyte is Monoprotic, Diprotic, or Triprotic.
  * Once the Titrant and Analyte have been selected, the Assign Parameters button will function. Clicking on the Assign Parameters button will open a menu with boxes to enter the required data to plot the requested titration curve. Clicking Ok will save the data.
  * Clicking Force Plot after the data has been entered will put a plot into the plot section. 
  * Quit will exit the program.
