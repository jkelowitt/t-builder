I'm trying to solve a problem I've been having with the alpha values part of this code. 

To make this easier, I'm making a version of this code which is completely separate from any gui elements. 

In hindsight, this is the version I should have been making this whole time. 

I plan on adding a gui eventually, but only once the computational side is rock solid.
