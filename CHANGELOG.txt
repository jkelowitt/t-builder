T-Builder Changelog

A log of all changes which affect code performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New:
-

Fixed:
-

Updated:
- Updated to DearPyGUI v0.6.121
- Updated to scipy v1.6.0

Removed:
-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New:
- Refactored / Redesigned Gui
    - Larger Plots
    - Temperature adjustment in GUI
    - Save analysis data button
- Testing suite so I can test class changes more quickly
    - Test functions
    - Test data to compare against
- Save analysis function created and integrated to GUI.
- GUI examples to the README.md
- Link to jkelowitt/t-builder on title button.


Fixed:
- Labelled the titration generation setup.
    - The volume input is never where I think it is. This brute forces
        the input data to be put in the right places. New test data
        has been generated.

Updated:
- Increased the speed of the scale_alphas method by an order of
    magnitude
- Simplified alpha value calculation
- Removed temperature range warning from get_kw function.


Removed:
-



-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New:
- Author, version number, and license
- Precision input
- Code is now formatted to the black formatting standard

Fixed:
- Derivatives wouldn't work on basic solutions
    - This fix has the unintended benefit that the saved data files for
        basic solutions are now in the correct order. Since the basic
        solutions were calculated from 14 --> 0 instead of the normal
        0 --> 14, the data files were backwards and the derivatives
        broken.
- When the buffer point isn't exactly calculated due to precision errors
    the closest value will be chosen. This is true for the equivalence
    point.
- Concentrations can no longer be negative. Zero concentrations are
    calculated but not shown

Updated:
- Plots are now anti-aliased
- query_callback functions are now a single function
- Moved closest value calculating lambda function into a proper function
- DearPyGui --> Version 0.6.117
- Precision default kwargs
- Scaling function changed from sigmoid to algebraic (x / (1+|x|))


Removed:
- Unused function imports


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New:
- Icon
- requirements.txt file
- Equivalence point calculation
- Buffering point calculation
- Derivative calculations

Fixed:
- Various grammatical errors
- The Titration data values were being saved in the wrong order


Updated:
- trim_values function now allows the user to input any list as an arg
    to be trimmed to the correct length

Removed:
- Compounds file


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New:
- GUI  -->  DearPyGui
- Name! T-Builder

Updated:
- README.md instructions on how to run the program

Removed:
- Matplotlib
    - Since the plotting is taken care of in the GUI, this is no longer
       required.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New:
- Pulled Bjerrum and AcidBase classes out of the Titration class
- Added compound classes (including acidic and basic water)
- Tiny library of compound classes

Fixed:
- A call before definition error with __init__ of the AcidBase class

Updated:
- Titration class now requires you to make two compound classes and
   pass them in with their concentrations and the volume of analyte.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New:
- Updated to Python 3.8
- Titration class
- Equivalence volume calculator
- Alpha value curve plotting
- Example classes

Fixed:
- Ordering of write titration data columns
- All mathematical errors

Removed:
- All traces of GUI
